    "\n",

    "### Target leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "A target leak occurs when our predictors include data that will not be available at the time we make the predictions. It’s important to think of the target leak in terms of the timing or chronological order of data availability, and not just whether a feature makes good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-Test Contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "A different type of leak occurs when we are not careful to distinguish training data from validation data. Validation is meant to be a measure of how well the model performs on data it has not previously considered. We can subtly corrupt this process if the validation data affects preprocessing behaviour. This is referred to as train-test contamination."
